# ATM-Machine-Project
Hello Everyone!
This is an ATM Machine Project created by me using C++ and object oriented programming concepts.
This project consists of various ATM functionalities implemented using OOP concepts.
The functionalities are:
1) Making an Initial Deposit : The user can make an initial deposit into the account.
2) Checking Balance : The user can check the account balance.
3) Making Deposits and checking Balance after depositing.
4) Making Withdrawals and checking Balance after withdrawing : User can withdraw money from the ATM, but the only condition is that the amount to be withdrawn should be less than the user's account balance.
